        "- Can we classify product reviews as helpful or unhelpful?\n",
        "\n",

        "### Understanding DateTime Operations and Plotting\n",
        "\n",
        "**DateTime Conversion:**\n",
        "The `pd.to_datetime()` function is intelligent - it can parse many date formats:\n",
        "- \"2014-01-15\"\n",
        "- \"01/15/2014\"\n",
        "- \"January 15, 2014\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Once converted, the column has dtype `datetime64`, which enables special operations like:\n",
        "- Extracting components (year, month, day, hour)\n",
        "- Calculating differences (\"How many days between two dates?\")\n",
        "- Filtering (\"Select all reviews from 2014\")\n",
        "\n",
        "**The `.dt` Accessor:**\n",
        "For datetime columns, `.dt` provides access to datetime-specific methods:\n",
        "- `.dt.year`, `.dt.month`, `.dt.day`: Extract numerical components\n",
        "- `.dt.day_name()`, `.dt.month_name()`: Get text names\n",
        "- `.dt.weekday`: Get day of week as number (Monday=0, Sunday=6)\n",
        "- `.dt.quarter`: Get fiscal quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Plotting with Pandas:**\n",
        "Pandas DataFrames and Series have a `.plot()` method that creates matplotlib figures. Parameters include:\n",
        "- `kind`: Type of plot ('bar', 'line', 'hist', 'box', 'scatter', 'pie')\n",
        "- `figsize`: Tuple specifying figure dimensions in inches\n",
        "- `color`: Color of plot elements\n",
        "- `title`: Plot title\n",
        "\n",
        "The `plt.show()` function from matplotlib displays the plot. In Jupyter notebooks, plots often display automatically, but `plt.show()` ensures compatibility."

        "\n",
        "In this lecture, we've completed a full text mining pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text Preprocessing**: Converted raw review text into clean, standardized format\n",
        "   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**: Transformed text into numerical representation\n",
        "   - Bag of words approach creating term-document matrix\n",
        "   - Dimensionality reduction by filtering rare words\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Model Training**: Built LASSO logistic regression classifier\n",
        "   - L1 regularization for automatic feature selection\n",
        "   - Selected ~750 predictive words from thousands of candidates\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using multiple metrics\n",
        "   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC\n",
        "   - Achieved strong predictive performance (AUC ≈ 0.87)\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Interpretation**: Visualized and understood model decisions\n",
        "   - Identified most important positive and negative words\n",
        "   - Created word clouds for intuitive communication\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why LASSO Works for Text:**\n",
        "- Text data is extremely high-dimensional (thousands of words)\n",
        "- Most words are irrelevant for prediction\n",
        "- LASSO automatically identifies the predictive subset\n",
        "- Result: Interpretable models with good performance\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bag of Words Limitations:**\n",
        "While simple and effective, bag of words:\n",
        "- Ignores word order (\"not good\" vs \"good\")\n",
        "- Misses context and sarcasm\n",
        "- Treats each word independently\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensions like n-grams can partially address these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Applications:**\n",
        "The techniques demonstrated here apply to:\n",
        "- Customer feedback analysis\n",
        "- Product review monitoring\n",
        "- Social media sentiment tracking\n",
        "- Email spam detection\n",
        "- Document classification\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "To deepen your text mining skills:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Try different preprocessing**: Experiment with/without stemming, different stopword lists\n",
        "2. **Explore n-grams**: Capture word sequences (bi-grams, tri-grams)\n",
        "3. **Try TF-IDF**: Weight words by inverse document frequency\n",
        "4. **Use other models**: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks\n",
        "5. **Deep learning**: Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and LSTMs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Final Thoughts\n",
        "\n",
        "Text mining opens up vast possibilities for extracting insights from unstructured data. The simple bag-of-words + LASSO approach we've demonstrated achieves strong results and provides interpretability - always valuable in real applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember: **Start simple, evaluate thoroughly, iterate thoughtfully.**"
